Building from source to install isn't as easy as it should be. I'm
making changes to use autotools, maven, and git but there are a 
large number of components which all work together. If anyone
is interested in working on source development our building from
source contact me through the website and I will glad to work with 
with you to get you up and going. Plus that will give me a reason
to document the proces for others. As I will be making a wide range
of pre-built binaries I expect *almost* everyone to go that route.
